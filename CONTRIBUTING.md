# Contributing to beans-vscode

Welcome and thank you for contributing. This document outlines the development workflow, tests, and pull request expectations for this repository.

## Developer principles

- TDD-first: write a failing test for new behavior before implementing production code.
- Small, focused PRs with clear description and test coverage.
- Use conventional commits for commit messages (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).

## Branch naming

- Feature branches: `feature/<bean-id>-<short-slug>` or `feat/<ticket>-<short-slug>`
- Bugfix branches: `fix/<ticket>-<short-slug>`

For work tracked with Beans, include the Bean ID in the branch name when available.

## Running the project

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run compile
pnpm run watch    # dev incremental
pnpm test         # run unit tests
```

## Tests

- Unit tests are run with Vitest. Use the mocks under `src/test/mocks` when possible.
- The test environment includes a custom `.md` loader to import markdown templates used by Copilot artifacts.

## Copilot artifacts and MCP

- Copilot instruction files are generated by `src/beans/config/*` and written to `.github/instructions/`.
- The MCP server can be run locally via the built `dist/beans-mcp-server.js` script (see README for examples).

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] Tests added/updated for new behavior
- [ ] `pnpm run compile` succeeds
- [ ] `pnpm test` passes
- [ ] README/CONTRIBUTING updated if public behavior changed

## Issues and Beans

This project uses Beans for issue tracking. Create Beans issues/epics for larger work and include the bean ID in branch names and PR descriptions when possible.
