# Beans Task Management Rules

**Non-negotiable — follow every rule every time, without exception.**

1. **Never start work without a bean.** Before writing any code or making any change, find a relevant existing bean or create a new one. Set its status to `in-progress`. There are no exceptions.

2. **Always use the extension or MCP first.** Invoke Beans operations through the VS Code extension commands or MCP tools. Use the `@beans` chat participant for guidance. Fall back to the CLI only when the extension, chat, and MCP are genuinely unavailable — and even then, read the constraints below.

3. **Track all work in the bean's body.** Maintain a `## Todo` checklist in the bean body. After each completed step, mark the item done and sync the bean. Never use TodoWrite, editor scratch pads, or ad-hoc lists.

4. **Commit beans promptly.**
   - Commit a bean immediately after creating or modifying it — unless you are creating a milestone/epic and are about to create its child beans, in which case commit everything together once the hierarchy is complete.
   - Completed todo items may be committed together with the code changes they relate to.

5. **Create a branch before you write code.** When starting work on a bean, create a new branch named after the bean (e.g. `feature/<bean-id>-<slug>`) unless the current branch is already directly related to that bean. Push the branch before making your first commit.

6. **Record the branch and PR in the bean.** As soon as a branch or PR exists, add it to the bean's YAML frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   branch: feature/<bean-id>-<slug>
   pr: <pr-number>
   ```

   Commit this update immediately.

7. **Closing a bean.**
   - Completed: add a `## Summary of Changes` section, then set status to `completed`.
   - Scrapped: add a `## Reasons for Scrapping` section, then set status to `scrapped`.

# Beans Usage Guide for Agents (Extension-First)

This file is generated by the Beans VS Code extension and defines the preferred execution model.

## Interface priority (highest → lowest)

**Always try each level in order. Only descend when the level above is genuinely unavailable.**

1. **Beans VS Code extension commands/UI** ← start here every time
2. **Beans chat participant (`@beans`) and slash commands**
3. **Beans MCP tools**
4. **Beans CLI** ← last resort only; see constraints below

The CLI is a fallback for environments where the extension, chat participant, and MCP are all inaccessible. Do not prefer it for convenience.

## Generated artifact context

When AI features are enabled, the extension maintains:

- `.github/instructions/tasks.instructions.md`
- `.github/skills/beans/SKILL.md`

Use these as authoritative guidance for Beans workflows in this repository.

## Core Beans workflow

1. **Before any work:** search for a relevant bean using `beans.search` or `@beans /search`. If none fits, create one with `beans.create` and set it to `in-progress`.
2. **Create a branch** (if not already on one related to this bean). Name it `feature/<bean-id>-<slug>` or `fix/<bean-id>-<slug>`.
3. **Add branch/PR to bean frontmatter** as soon as they exist. Commit the bean update.
4. **Maintain a `## Todo` checklist** in the bean body. Update it after every completed step and commit the updated bean (alone or together with related code changes).
5. **On completion**, add `## Summary of Changes`, set status to `completed`, and commit the final bean state.
6. **On scrap**, add `## Reasons for Scrapping`, set status to `scrapped`, and commit.

## Extension commands (preferred)

- `beans.view`, `beans.create`, `beans.edit`
- `beans.setStatus`, `beans.setType`, `beans.setPriority`
- `beans.setParent`, `beans.removeParent`, `beans.editBlocking`
- `beans.search`, `beans.filter`, `beans.sort`, `beans.refresh`
- `beans.copyId`, `beans.delete` (allowed statuses only)

## Chat workflows (`@beans`)

- `/summary` — status overview
- `/priority` — top-priority active issues
- `/stale` — stale issues by age
- `/create` — issue creation guidance
- `/next` — suggest the next bean to start
- `/search` — issue search
- `/commit` — issue-related commit guidance

## MCP workflow

1. **Read/context first**: `beans_vscode_llm_context`, view, search, filter, sort.
2. **Mutate only with explicit intent**: create, edit, set status/type/priority, manage relationships.
3. **Destructive actions** (delete, archive) require explicit user confirmation unless the user already requested it.
4. MCP is the preferred programmatic interface when the extension UI is not in focus.

## Planning mode for epic decomposition

When planning an epic:

1. Confirm goal, constraints, and definition of done.
2. Propose a child-issue map grouped by outcomes.
3. For each child issue, include title, type, priority, and dependencies.
4. Ask for approval before creating any issues.
5. Create all approved child issues and link them with parent relationships.
6. **Commit the parent epic and all child beans together** once the hierarchy is complete.
7. Return created IDs and suggest the first issue to start.

Use compact planning checklist format:

- [ ] `<title>` — type=`<type>`, priority=`<priority>`, depends_on=`<ids|none>`

## CLI fallback (only when extension, chat, and MCP are all unavailable)

**Constraints when using the CLI:**

- Always use `--json` for output; never parse plain-text output.
- Never pass large blocks of body text directly as a shell argument. Write the body to a temp file and use `--body-file <path>` (or the equivalent flag) instead.
- Run one operation at a time; do not chain destructive commands.

**Allowed CLI commands:**

- `beans list --json --ready`
- `beans show --json <id> [id...]`
- `beans create --json --title "<title>" [--body-file <path>] ...`
- `beans update --json <id> [--body-file <path>] ...`
- `beans archive <id>` (only when explicitly requested by the user)

## Beans CLI baseline (from `beans prime`)
