Update the Copilot instructions template to tell users to:

- Start a new branch whenever beginning work on an issue that doesn't already have one.
- When resuming work, checkout the appropriate branch for the issue.
- Use branch names in the format: [type]/[issue-number-without-prefix]-[short-title] (e.g. feat/1234-add-search).

Add examples and a short note about pushing the branch and recording it in the bean frontmatter.
```
