Expand drag-and-drop test fidelity beyond unit-level handler coverage:

- Add integration-style tree interaction flows with parent-chain updates.
- Add stale update / concurrency conflict scenarios around re-parent mutations.
- Verify behavior with mixed status/type trees and larger ancestor chains.
