Rewrite global tasks.instructions.md to prioritize Beans VS Code extension, generated Copilot instructions/skill, MCP/chat workflows; keep CLI as backup.

## Summary of Changes

- Rewrote tasks.instructions.md to extension-first Beans workflow.
- Added explicit priority order: extension commands → chat participant → MCP → CLI backup.
- Merged guidance with generated Copilot artifacts (.github/instructions/beans.instructions.md and .github/skills/beans/SKILL.md).
- Added planning-mode epic decomposition workflow (propose/approve/create/link/report).
- Kept CLI command references as fallback only and retained bean lifecycle/completion rules.
