Add README docs describing the Copilot artifact generation flow: which module writes artifacts (`src/beans/config/*`), paths written (COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_RELATIVE_PATH), how to opt-in/opt-out (workspace state key), and why vitest/esbuild include a custom .md loader (mdTextPlugin). Include example commands to regenerate artifacts in dev.
