Add short top-of-file JSDoc comments and per-export JSDoc to explain purpose and public API for:

- src/beans/service/BeansService.ts
- src/beans/commands/BeansCommands.ts
- src/beans/mcp/BeansMcpIntegration.ts
- src/beans/chat/BeansChatIntegration.ts
- src/beans/tree/BeansTreeDataProvider.ts

Mark as good-first-issue; focus on concise, testable comments.
