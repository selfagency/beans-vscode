Create CONTRIBUTING.md and expand README Development section to document:

1) TDD-first workflow (write failing tests first),
2) branch naming conventions (feature/<bean-id>-<slug> or feat/<ticket>-<slug>),
3) Beans-specific workflow (use Beans issues/epics for tracking),
4) how to run local dev (watch, compile, debug extension, run MCP server).

Include examples, links to vitest .md loader notes, and a PR checklist.

## Summary of Changes
- Created a comprehensive `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
- Expanded the `README.md` Development section and consolidated redundant technical onboarding details.
- Updated `docs/testing.md` with explicit details about the Vitest markdown loader.
- Documented branch naming and TDD-first guidelines.
