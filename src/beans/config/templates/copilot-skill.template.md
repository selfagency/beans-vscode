# Beans Skill

This skill is the primary Beans VS Code skill for this workspace. It is generated into `.agents/skills/beans-vscode/SKILL.md` and should be treated as the main source of Beans workflow guidance for Copilot in this repository.

## Extremely important

- **Always use beans instead of TodoWrite to manage your work and tasks.**
- **Always use beans instead of writing ad-hoc todo lists in chat, notes, or scratch files.**
- **Before starting work, first check whether a relevant bean already exists. If not, create one and set it to `in-progress`.**
- **Keep the bean body current while you work, especially the `## Todo` checklist.**
- **When committing, include both code changes and bean changes when they changed together.**

## Interface priority

**Always use the highest available interface. Never skip levels for convenience.**

1. **Beans VS Code extension commands/UI** (`beans.*`) — preferred whenever the IDE is available
2. **Beans MCP tools** — preferred for programmatic workflows when the UI is not in focus
3. **`@beans` chat participant** — for guidance, summaries, and structured workflows
4. **CLI** — only when extension, chat, and MCP are all genuinely unavailable; see CLI constraints

## Core rules (always enforced)

- **Never start work without a bean.** Find a relevant bean or create one first. No exceptions.
- **Prefer extension commands/UI first, then MCP tools.** Do not reach for the CLI unless all other interfaces are unavailable.
- **The bean is the source of truth.** Keep status, type, priority, parent, blocking, and body current.
- **Create a branch before writing code.** Use a Git Flow topic prefix aligned to the bean type and urgency.
- **Record branch and PR in bean frontmatter.** Add `branch:` and `pr:` as soon as they exist; commit immediately.
- **Commit beans promptly.** Commit after create/edit unless building an epic hierarchy (batch commit everything together).
- **Track todos in the bean body.** Maintain a `## Todo` checklist; update and commit after every completed step.

## Git Flow branch mapping

Use standard Git Flow topic prefixes and align them to the bean type:

- **`feature/`** — default for `feature`, `task`, and most implementation work under an `epic`
- **`bugfix/`** — default for `bug` beans that are not urgent production fixes
- **`hotfix/`** — only for urgent production or release-blocking `bug` beans that must ship immediately
- **`support/`** — for `milestone`-driven maintenance, release-support work, or cross-cutting operational follow-up where `feature/` is not a fit
- **`develop`** — integration base branch, **not** a topic-branch prefix to create per bean

Recommended mapping by bean type:

- `feature` → `feature/<bean-id>-<slug>`
- `task` → `feature/<bean-id>-<slug>` unless the task is clearly a bug fix or support-line maintenance
- `bug` → `bugfix/<bean-id>-<slug>` by default, or `hotfix/<bean-id>-<slug>` for urgent production fixes
- `epic` → usually **do not work directly on the epic**; create child beans and branch from the child bean type instead
- `milestone` → usually coordination-only; if direct branch work is required, prefer `support/<bean-id>-<slug>`

## Agent constraints (must-follow)

- **Always create or switch to the bean's branch before editing code or files.**
  - If a branch exists for the bean, checkout it first. If not, create and push a new branch following the Git Flow mapping above.
  - Record the branch in the bean frontmatter immediately after creating or checking out the branch.

- **Do not keep an internal agent todo list.**
  - All task state and subtasks must live in the bean's `## Todo` checklist in the bean body.
  - The agent must update the bean `## Todo` via extension commands or MCP tools and commit the bean to persist progress.

- **Do not create or edit bean files by hand.**
  - Use the extension commands or MCP tools for bean creation and edits; never write `.md` bean files directly to the repository.
  - The agent must not add custom frontmatter keys except `branch` and `pr`.

## Starting work on a bean

1. Orient yourself first: use `beans.search`, the search view, or `@beans /next` / `@beans /search <keywords>` to find existing work.
2. If none found, create one with the extension or MCP: set title, type, priority, and body/description.
3. Set status to `in-progress`.
4. Create a Git Flow topic branch aligned to the bean type and urgency.
5. Edit the bean to add `branch: <name>` to its frontmatter.
6. Commit the bean file with message: `chore(beans): start <bean-id> — set branch`.

## During work

- Add a `## Todo` checklist to the bean body on first edit.
- After each completed step: check off the item, save the bean, and commit the bean with related code changes.
- If scope grows, create child beans and link them with parent relationships instead of overloading one bean.

## Completing or scrapping a bean

**Complete:**

1. Add `## Summary of Changes` to the bean body.
2. Set status to `completed`.
3. Commit: `chore(beans): complete <bean-id>`.

**Scrap:**

1. Add `## Reasons for Scrapping` to the bean body.
2. Set status to `scrapped`.
3. Commit: `chore(beans): scrap <bean-id>`.

## Available MCP tools

Use MCP when automating outside the VS Code UI. Prefer these tool groups in this order: discover → inspect → mutate.

## Chat participant (`@beans`) guidance

`@beans` is the human-facing conversational interface. Use it for orientation, guidance, and structured workflows. It reads beans and returns natural-language responses; it does **not** mutate state.

Useful slash commands:

- `/summary`
- `/priority`
- `/stale`
- `/next`
- `/create`
- `/search <query>`
- `/commit`

## MCP tool guidance

Use MCP tools when automation is needed outside the VS Code UI:

1. **Default workflow** — discover with `beans_query` (`ready`, `refresh`, `filter`, `search`, `sort`, `llm_context`), inspect with `beans_view`, mutate with `beans_update`, use `beans_complete_tasks` for checklist work, then archive only when explicitly requested.
2. **Read context first** — prefer `beans_query` for `llm_context`, `refresh`, `filter`, `search`, `sort`, `ready`, and GraphQL operations; use `beans_view` when you need full bean payloads.
3. **Mutate with explicit intent** — prefer `beans_update` for most metadata/body changes; use `beans_create` for single items and `beans_bulk_create` / `beans_bulk_update` when decomposing epics or moving batches.
4. **Use file/log helpers intentionally** — `beans_bean_file` is the supported path for `.beans` file access, and `beans_output` is the supported path for log access.
5. **Destructive actions** — `beans_delete` and `beans_archive` require explicit user confirmation unless the user already requested them.
6. Prefer MCP over the CLI for any scripted or agent-driven operation.

### MCP gotchas and field guidance

- `beans_update` supports `status`, `type`, `priority`, `parent`, `clearParent`, `blocking`, `blockedBy`, `body`, `bodyAppend`, `bodyReplace`, and optional optimistic concurrency via `ifMatch`.
- `beans_update` cannot combine `body` with `bodyAppend` or `bodyReplace` in the same request.
- `beans_create` prefers `body`; `description` remains only a deprecated alias.
- Batch tools are **best-effort**, so callers must inspect per-item results instead of assuming atomic success.
- `beans_delete` only allows `draft` or `scrapped` beans unless force-delete is explicitly intended.
- `beans_reopen` requires the current status to match the reopen target (`completed` or `scrapped`).
- Prefer `beanId` (not `id`) for MCP updates.
- Use `ifMatch` with the bean `etag` from `beans_view` when concurrent edits are possible.

### Relationship semantics

- **Parent** — hierarchy (`milestone → epic → feature → task/bug`)
- **Blocking** — this bean blocks another bean
- **BlockedBy** — this bean depends on another bean; prefer this when modeling new dependencies

### Query and GraphQL examples

- Actionable work: `beans_query` with `operation: "ready"`
- Full refresh: `beans_query` with `operation: "refresh"`
- Search by text: `beans_query` with `operation: "search"`
- Advanced queries/mutations: `beans_query` with `operation: "graphql"`

## Planning mode: epic decomposition

When the user asks to plan an epic or decompose a feature:

### Step 1 — Clarify

Ask (or confirm from context):

- What is the end goal?
- Are there known constraints?
- What is the definition of done?
- Does an epic/milestone bean already exist?

### Step 2 — Create the epic bean (if needed)

Use the extension or MCP to create the parent bean first.

### Step 3 — Propose the issue map

Present a compact checklist for approval before creating anything:

```text
- [ ] <title> — type=<task|feature|bug>, priority=<①–⑤>, depends_on=<bean-ids or none>
```

Do not create any beans until the user approves the plan.

### Step 4 — Create child beans

Create approved child beans with the extension or MCP and link them to the parent.

### Step 5 — Return a summary

Reply with the created IDs and recommend the best bean to start first.

Example summary format:

```text
Epic:    <epic-id> <epic-title>
Created: <id> <title> [depends_on: <ids>]
         <id> <title>
Start with: <id> <title> — <one-line reason>
```

## CLI fallback (last resort only)

Use CLI only when extension, `@beans`, and MCP tools are all unavailable.

**Hard constraints:**

- Always use `--json`; never parse plain-text output.
- Never pass large body text as a shell argument; use GraphQL variables or pipe the query into `beans graphql`.
- One operation at a time; no chained destructive commands.
- Before using the CLI at all, verify the extension, chat participant, and MCP tooling are genuinely unavailable.

## Beans baseline

The following baseline is derived from `beans graphql --schema` and provides comprehensive guidance for working with beans in this project.
