## About Beans

Beans is a modern, file-based issue tracker designed for developers who want their issues to live alongside their code. Each "bean" is a markdown file in your repository—no databases, no external services, just version-controlled files.

**Why file-based?**

- ✅ Version controlled with your code
- ✅ Readable in any text editor
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ No vendor lock-in
- ✅ Greppable and scriptable
- ✅ Perfect for remote development
